### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello, I'm Ashleigh! I' m a programmer by training, and am currently working as the Application Development Manager at Neovation Learning Solutions (which is just a fancy way of saying I boss around the dev, UX and QA teams). 

I believe that everyone deserves an accessible experience, whether in the physical or digital worlds, and I'm doing what I can to bring that idea to those around me. I've spoken about accessibility at TedxWinnipeg 2019, Prairie Dev Con Winnipeg & Regina, ConFoo Montreal and to various local schools and industry groups in Winnipeg and Manitoba.  

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: general nerdery (tv shows, movies, comics, PokÃ©mon Go, Animal Crossing: New Horizons)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: hit me up on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/shimmoril) for lots of a11y retweets and the occassional personal tidbit
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
- âš¡ "Fun" fact: I have fibromyalgia, which is how I became interested and aware of accessibility initially.
